                I've always been a fan of stories.
                For longer than I can remember, I've been fascinated by language and worldbuilding.
                From coming up with Dungeons and Dragons campaigns to investigating US housing data,
                there are interesting topics to be found everywhere.
            </p>

                I graduated from UCSD in 2022 with a degree in Data Science and Cognitive Science,
                during which I interned at InVia Robotics and the San Diego Supercomputer Center.
                Both positions hired me full-time after their respective internships, and I continued working at the Supercomputer Center after graduation.
                My next position was as a Data Scientist at Fulcra Dynamics Corporation, designing and building data infrastructure to support Digital Twins.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days, I work on personal projects and keep pace with the rapid development of AI, and optimize the minutia of the machines I currently work with.
                I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out!
