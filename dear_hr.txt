to whom it may concern,

please find attached a post card containing my soul
written in the format of a cover letter
you never got around to reading.

i also included a resume that lists
the history lessons i repeated by accident
though
you could have found that on my linkedin profile
a single scroll down in the media section.

im reaching out to you today
like a falling climber desperately tries different handholds
or crabs in sandy buckets wish for escape ropes to cling to.
im pleading
as king richard
for a horse to take me to safety
or as a doctor without borders
begs a warlord for a position.

my previous experiences have taught me
so many things
like how to smile when recruiter number whatever hundred
asks for clarification about when a position ended
instead of what i was doing there or
how it relates at all to what we were discussing.

i learned
how to answer self disqualifying questions
with correct pop quiz responses
such as
what kind of salary were you looking for in this job
by which i mean
pick a number
any number
and if its too high then we wont even consider you
undersell yourself or else risk hr throwing your application out
like
i might not get commission unless they hire you
so why would i bother sending your resume over
to which the magpie replies
do you happen to know the budget available
instead of
why are you asking me this question 30 minutes into the interview
